# Todo-ReactApp
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project! I developed a responsive Todo App using React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. This app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with real-time updates, thanks to Firebase's database. It supports CRUD operations, enabling users to add, update, and delete tasks seamlessly. Tailwind CSS ensures the app is visually appealing and responsive on all devices. Key features include real-time data synchronization, interactive UI with React Icons, and a component-based architecture for better maintainability. This project has significantly enhanced my full-stack development skills

Key Features:
Real-Time Data Synchronization: Firebase ensures that todos are updated in real-time across all devices.
CRUD Operations: Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete todos seamlessly.
Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS ensures the app looks great on both desktop and mobile screens.
Interactive UI: Checkbox toggles for marking tasks as complete and a simple delete function to remove tasks.

Code Highlights:
Real-Time Updates: Used Firebase's onSnapshot to listen for real-time changes.
Component-Based Architecture: Built modular components for better code maintainability and reusability.
State Management: Managed state using React's useState and useEffect hooks for efficient data handling.
